      question: "What is YieldScan?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          YieldScan is a DeFi yield aggregator that helps users find and optimize the best returns on their 
          yield-bearing crypto assets—without oracles, validators, or automated rebalancing.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "general"
    },
    {
      question: "How is YieldScan different from other DeFi yield platforms?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Unlike other platforms, YieldScan is fully user-driven. No hidden automation, no smart contract custody, 
          and no auto-deploys. You stay in full control.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "general"
    },
    
    // Yield & Optimization section
    {
      question: "How does YieldScan find the best yields?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          We monitor APYs from top protocols like Aave, Compound, Morpho, and Pendle in real-time, 
          highlighting better opportunities for yield-bearing assets like aUSDC or cDAI.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "yield"
    },
    {
      question: "What does \"optimize yield\" mean?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          If you're holding a token like aUSDC but cUSDC is yielding more, we'll show you a one-click option 
          to migrate and earn more—without you having to compare rates manually.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "yield"
    },
    {
      question: "Does YieldScan support base tokens (e.g., USDC)?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. For base tokens, we show available options across protocols so you can choose the best place 
          to deposit initially.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "yield"
    },
    
    // Security section
    {
      question: "Is my crypto safe on YieldScan?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. YieldScan does not take custody of your funds. All actions are initiated by you directly on 
          trusted protocols via your connected wallet.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "security"
    },
    {
      question: "Are there smart contract risks?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          As with any DeFi interaction, risks exist. We only surface protocols with established security records, 
          and you choose where and when to interact.
        </p>

      category: "security"

    // Technical section
    {
      question: "What tokens are supported?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          We currently support major stablecoins and their yield-bearing versions (USDC, USDT, aUSDC, cUSDC, etc.). 
          More tokens are added regularly.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "technical"
    },
    {
      question: "Which blockchains are supported?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Initially focused on Ethereum mainnet. Support for L2s like Arbitrum and Base is coming soon.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "technical"
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to approve tokens?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. As with any dApp, you'll need to approve tokens before interacting with protocols. 
          We guide you through each step clearly.
        </p>

      category: "technical"
    },
    
    // Strategy & Performance section
    {
      question: "Is there a fee for using YieldScan?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          No platform fees. If using an optimizer vault (coming soon), we charge a transparent, 
          yield-based performance fee.
        </p>
      ),
      category: "strategy"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I see my performance over time?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. YieldScan offers portfolio tracking and historical yield comparisons so you can see how 
          much better you're doing.
        </p>

    // Other section
    {
      question: "Do you use AI?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes. Our AI models monitor social sentiment and liquidity changes across DeFi to alert you 
          if something looks risky in a protocol you're using.
        </p>

      question: "Who is YieldScan for?",
      answer: (
        <p>
          Anyone looking to make the most of their yield-bearing assets—whether you're a DeFi veteran 
          or just starting out.
